## Guide
This dashboard calls ***Farm Observer*** which contains different parameters describing crop growing condition.  
  
1. You can specify the crop you would like to observe on the top right hand corner. I have included basil and pea here.
2. In the upper half of the the dashborad, it shows the effect of temperature, humidity and pH on yield. Again, you can specify the parameters you would like to observe from the drop-down list next to the subtitle *Factors on Yield*.
3. The lower half of the dashboard explores other attibutes including harvest time, seed input and yield across time.
4. Every single observation in this dashboard represents each harvest. There are 50 trials for both basil and pea datasets. If you are instereted in a particular trial, just click on it then it will be highlighted on both graphs.

## Insight
With trend line added, significant correlations in temperature and humidity with yield are discovered respectively. A lower temperature and a higher humidity will raise the yield.  
**ALERT!!** The data was generated randomly in the purpose of building a trial dashboard. Futher application on real datasets shuld be carried out.
